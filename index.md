## Intro to JS
How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
This is just an example of one of the projects that I had completed during the codecademy lesson. Javascript has a similar structure to Python(a language I’m sort of familiar with) so reviewing it was very beneficial and it came easier to me in comparison to other languages. Reviewing it might’ve helped solidify my understanding of the basic structure of code and is something I can apply to more than just Java. The midterm in particular was quite stressful but I remember the Java portion not being too hard which might’ve been because of the familiar layout(I was still very rusty but it wasn’t a completely new concept like html had been this year). As you can see in the code above, it has a very simple layout where you state your variables at the beginning and then you do the if and else if statements.  I think something anyone would learn from Javascript might just be the basic layout of a lot of languages and the subtle differences that it might have from other languages. Also, some of the code that we had to use this year had JS and HTML at the same time, and something like this could allow you to have some background knowledge on how to use JS so that you can look up examples on the internet or examples that your friends made and figure out on your own how to connect all of them.


```markdown 
//made a variable set to a number 
let myAge = 15;
//made a variable set to 2
let earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears *= 10.5;
let laterYears = myAge-2;
laterYears *= 4;
// printing the two values
console.log(earlyYears);
console.log(laterYears);
//adding the two values
myAgeInDogYears = laterYears + earlyYears;
//writing my name in lowercase
myName = 'Meriem Sibachir'.toLowerCase();
console.log('My name is ' + myName +' I am ' +myAge + ' years old in human years which is ' + myAgeInDogYears + ' years old in dog years.');
```
## Intro to HTML/CSS
How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
HTML was actually a completely new language that I had never touched before and has a VERY different layout to the languages that we looked at over the past 2 years. This opportunity definitely made me go out of my comfort zone and it was one of those languages that you kind of need help with new concepts because it isn’t something you’re completely familiar with. Despite that, HTML does have a very simple system(you kind of just embed everything with the appropriate statements and you’re good) so I quickly became a lot more comfortable with it. It also allowed me to code properly during the Hackaton and having this previous experience probably helped me become a bit more familiar with HTML and its layout.  Since a lot of people don’t use HTML until they’re in grade 12 computer science, I think this would just allow them to learn a completely different layout when it comes to computer science and, honestly, a much more simplified way of coding what you want. A lot of codes in the real world use HTML(I saw online that you use it for websites) so that might be a life skill as well since you can potentially use it in the future for your own benefit. Although you might not remember exactly how to code with HTML, you would just have to brush up on the basics and the rest should come back to you.

## p5.JS
How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
For this module, I really don’t remember much about it. So to be completely honest, I will likely not be using this module to learn as a student and it was probably one of those modules where I relied heavily on the instructions and hints(I actually think that the walk through assignment that we did recently was a lot more effective because it really allowed me to learn what I needed to learn about a specific code and walk through it with the class). I also don’t think JS is my best language so I likely maybe had some issues with just understanding the layout. Someone else on the other hand might’ve enjoyed the creative aspect a little bit more. Someone else might have learned how to position certain things and how to make certain shapes/art pieces. They also would have increased their knowledge of JS and how to structure it when it comes to creative pieces.

How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
For this module, I mostly used my skills of building off of what is already given to me and trying to reshape it and remold it to what my goal is. This is very advanced JS and I wasn’t and still am not at a point where I can completely just make a code of whatever idea I have in mind. Therefore, I just used the code that they gave me and tried to understand it enough to tweak it and add snippets of other codes to make it something different. In this module, you can use coding to express your creative side and use it to better understand JS. I also am not super used to reading mini articles to understand computer science concepts which is something I am lacking in, therefore this module was a bit harder for me. I think this module can expose anyone to harder computer science concepts and it can allow them to dip their feet into harder pieces of code with different types of structures.

```markdown 
 
let  ballCount = 100;
let x = [];
let y = [];
let xSpeed= [];
let size = [];
let r = [];
let g = [];
let b = [];
 
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  for (i = 0 ; i<ballCount ; i++){
   x[i] = width/2;
   y[i] = height/2;
 xSpeed[i] = random(-5,5);
ySpeed[i] = random(-5,5);
size [i]= random(10,50);
r[i] = random(0, 256)
g[i] =random(0, 256)
b[i] = random(0, 256)
  }
}
function draw() {
  background(0, 50);
  for (i = 0 ; i<ballCount ; i++){
x[i]+= xSpeed[i];
y[i]+= ySpeed[i];
if (x[i] < 0|| x[i]> width){
 xSpeed[i]+= -1;
}
if() y[i]< 0 || y[i]> height){
  ySpeed [i] += -1;
}
fill (r[i], g[i], b[i]);
noStroke();
ellipse (x[i],y[i], size[i], size[i]);
 
  }
  
} 

```

## Computer Science Principles: programming.
How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
In the beginning of the course, I had not done any computer science for an entire year because I had grade ten computer science as one of my first classes the year before, therefore having these mini assignments really helped me brush up on my basic understanding of code. Also, in this Module, you learn pseudocode which I believe helped me immensely because it connected what I did during the last two years with what we would do this year(because pseudocode is kind of like the spine of every code). Also, this type of learning when it came to computer science was a bit foreign to me (reading articles) so this module exposed me to a different type of learning. I think anyone who would use this module would learn basic skills when it comes to computer science and it can even expose them to certain types of programming such as Javascript and it can lead them to better learn the different things that are specific to JS and are not found in other languages. I also remember a lot of problem solving and even some math, therefore someone can even improve their thinking skills and problem solving skills when it comes to comp sci. 



## Live coding session 
How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
During the live coding session, the students that I followed along with were coding for Flappy bird. Since I’m definitely not the fastest coder, I actually had a hard time following along and I didn’t finish the code fully. The experience definitely shows me how many more computer science concepts there are and that I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to Javascript. I also think that it showed me how I sometimes don’t fully understand concepts unless I learn the concept beforehand or if someone explains the code line by line and what exactly each line means. For example, for my walkthrough. Someone else could expand their knowledge on JS and, if they’re already pretty well versed in the language, they can use it as an opportunity to learn more concepts and use it for future projects. This walkthrough also happened to be a game, therefore someone who is more experienced can use something like this in the future and incorporate it into a game they would like to make themselves.  





## Creative coding session
: How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
This module was really stressful at first because I didn’t understand what I was supposed to be doing, but after I got clarification, it was so much less daunting and hard. This module really allowed me to experiment with numbers and shapes and patterns. This type of programming is very good because it makes you very familiar with the code and you learn a lot of concepts that can help you in the future. I also learned about making another class in order to add another frame. Something like this allows you to use your critical thinking and kind of break down the parts of the code that work together(for example, for a class you would have a part in the beginning and then you would call it later on) and it also might allow you to learn positioning, colours and movement of shapes.

## Hackathon 
: How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
This was probably the best part of this course. It was a lot of fun having full creative control over what we wanted to do for our project with minimal guidelines. I think it allowed us to really enjoy planning and researching the codes, as well as help us improve our understanding of HTML. I think this module really allowed me to learn about teamwork and how group members are not only people you split work with but rather people you actively work with, ask questions to and share snippets of code so that you can all benefit from it therefore improving the project as a whole. I also think having the responsibility of completing a certain section of the website really allowed me to work hard and effectively finish my part so that I don’t fall short and disappoint my group members. During the experience, we also had the opportunity to do certain things and explore certain computer science concepts, but we needed to think realistically based on our time and skills and decide not to.

## Creative refactoring 
: How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
This module was one of the modules that I found interesting. For the refactoring, we needed to make another class to the code that we already had(the bezier curves code). For me, I combined a code that I had previously worked on with the bezier curve concept! This opportunity allowed me to tweak the code, seeing what variations worked and which ones didn’t, seeing where a certain part of the code should go and how to incorporate both codes so that they would both show up on the screen. A module like this would allow anyone to learn more about the already existing code so that they can add an object refactoring, and again, it would allow them to really think about placement and solve any problems that may arise. 
```markdown 
let bug;
let bug2;
let bugs = [];
let scene = 0;
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  bug = new Dot(100, 200);
  bug2 = new Dot(200, 100);
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    bugs.push(new Dot (random(400), random(400)));
  }
}
function draw() {
  if (scene % 3 == 0) {
    art();
  }
}
function mouseClicked() {
  scene++;
}

function art() {
  bug.show();
  bug2.show();
  for (let i = 0; i < bugs.length; i++) {
    bugs[i].show();
    stroke(255);
  strokeWeight(100);
  point(0, 500);
  point(mouseX, mouseY);
  point(400, 400);
  point(600, 300);

  strokeWeight(6);
  noFill();
  bezier(0, 300, mouseX, mouseY, 400, 400, 600, 300);
  }



  
}

## GITHUB
How will I continue to use programming/computer science to continue to learn as a student? What aspects of the module made the most significant impact on you as a student?
Github was a module that honestly really confused me but it wasn’t too difficult to get through. Thankfully, the website provided step by step lessons and allowed you to complete the tasks that were at hand on your own. It kind of familiarized me with GITHUB and helped me understand it just enough to later on use it during the course in another project. Someone who had a bit of knowledge about github prior to finishing this assignment could have used this as a great learning tool that they could use to practice and better understand the process of github. Nonetheless, it exposed me to a completely different platform that I have never used in the past few years and familiarized me with the platform so that I could use it in the future!
